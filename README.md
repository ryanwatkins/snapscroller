SnapScroller
============

SnapScroller - an Enyo 2.0 kind to Snap to scrolling positions

A simple scroller that 'snaps' to the position of its controls.  You can manually snapTo a specific control index to provide external control of the scroll position for a carousel-like effect.  If you correctly size your components you can also define a 'peek' value to show a portion of the previous and next elements rather than snapping all the way to the item position - allowing a clip of the next/prev items if creating a carousel-like component.
Specify the "horizontal" and "vertical" properties of a normal Scroller to define if it should snap vertically or horizontally.

This component does not handle all the cases of the Enyo 1.0 SnapScroller control.  It is intended for one main item in view at a time - may require additional work to correctly handle some other cases - comments and pull requests welcome!

See a variety of examples in "samples" directory.


NOTES:

- on Android 4.1+ sometimes there is 'wobble' when snapping into position
- overscroll on first/last can get sometimes 'stuck'
- you can sometimes get stuck 'between' controls
