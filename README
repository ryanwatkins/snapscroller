SnapScroller - an Enyo 2.0 kind to Snap to scrolling positions

A simple scroller that 'snaps' to the position of its controls.  You
can manually snapTo a specific control index to provide external
control of the scroll position for a carousel-like effect.  If you
correctly size your components you can also define a 'peek' value to
show a portion of the previous and next elements rather than snapping
all the way to the item position - allowing a clip of the next/prev
items if creating a carousel-like component.

Specify the "horizontal" and "vertical" properties of a normal
Scroller to define if it should snap vertically or horizontally.

This component does not handle all the cases of the Enyo 1.0
SnapScroller control.  It is intended for one main item in view at a
time - may require additiona work to correctly handle some other cases
- comments and pull requests welcome!


See 'examples' for a demonstration on how to use it.


Tested platforms include: iOS 5+, Chrome 17+, Safari 5.1+
